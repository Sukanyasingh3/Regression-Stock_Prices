# Stock Price Prediction Using Different Regression Models

This repository contains a machine learning project that focuses on predicting stock prices using various regression algorithms. The project leverages historical stock price data and relevant features to build and evaluate regression models for price prediction.

The primary goal of this project is to explore different regression techniques and evaluate their performance in predicting stock prices. 

  ## Dataset
  [World Stock Prices Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/world-stock-prices-daily-updating)

  The dataset used for this project includes the following features:
- Date: The date of the stock price data.
- Open: The opening price of the stock on that date.
- High: The highest price the stock reached during the trading day.
- Low: The lowest price the stock reached during the trading day.
- Close: The closing price of the stock on that date.
- Volume: The trading volume, i.e., the number of shares traded on that date.
